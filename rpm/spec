to DNS transactions and protocol options.

%changelog
* Fri Dec 23 2016 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.3.0-1
- Release 1.3.0
  * Rare lockup has been fixed that could happen if a signal was received
    in the wrong thread at the wrong time due to `pcap_thread_stop()`
    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.
  * New features:
    - Experimental CBOR DNS Stream format output, see `CBOR_DNS_STREAM.md`
    - Extended options to specify user and group to use when dropping
      privileges, see EXTENDED OPTIONS in man-page
